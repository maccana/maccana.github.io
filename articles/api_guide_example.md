# ðŸš€ [API Name]: Professional Integration Guide

> This guide follows technical writing best practices to provide developers with a clear, concise path to successfully integrating the [API Name] service into their applications.

---

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

All requests to the [API Name] must be authenticated using a **Bearer Token** obtained via the [Specify Flow, e.g., OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow].

### 1.1. Obtaining Your API Key

1. Register your application at the [Link to Developer Portal] Developer Portal.

2. Navigate to the **Settings > Credentials** tab to generate your unique **`CLIENT_ID`** and **`CLIENT_SECRET`**.

### 1.2. The Authentication Request

Exchange your credentials for a short-lived access token.

```bash
curl -X POST '[AUTH_URL]/token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_ID&client_secret=YOUR_SECRET'
```

A successful response returns your token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOi...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

### 1.3. Securely Using the Token

Include the `access_token` in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API calls.

```bash
curl -X GET '[BASE_URL]/v1/status' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...'
```

## 2. Core Endpoint: Data Retrieval

The primary resource for retrieving [Type of Data] is the **`/v1/resources`** endpoint. This endpoint supports powerful filtering and pagination.

### 2.1. Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` | Yes | N/A | The unique identifier for the requested resource. |
| `limit` | `integer` | No | 20 | Limits the number of results per page (Max: 50). |
| `status` | `string` | No | `active` | Filters results by resource status: `active`, `pending`, or `archived`. |

## 3. The Response Body and Data Dictionary

The API uses standard JSON formatting. Data objects are returned within the `payload` array.

### 3.1. Response Structure Example

```json
{
  "request_id": "req_xyz123",
  "status": "ok",
  "pagination": {
    "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI...",
    "limit": 20
  },
  "payload": [
    {
      "resource_key": "RES-001A",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-27T10:00:00Z",
      "value": 42.50
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.2. Data Dictionary

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `payload[].resource_key` | `string` | Yes | A unique, immutable identifier for the resource. |
| `payload[].timestamp` | `ISO 8601` | Yes | The UTC time the data was recorded. |
| `payload[].value` | `number` | Yes | The primary metric value associated with the resource. |

## 4. Rate Limiting and Handling

To ensure stability, the API enforces a limit of **100 requests per minute (RPM)** per API key.

### 4.1. Rate Limit Headers

The following headers are included in every response to help you manage your rate limit consumption:

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum requests allowed in the current window (100). |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The UTC epoch time when the limit resets. |

### 4.2. Handling the 429 Error

If you exceed the limit, the API will return a **`HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`** status code. You must implement an **Exponential Backoff** strategy in your application logic to wait for the limit to reset before retrying.
